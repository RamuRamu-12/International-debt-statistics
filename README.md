## Description

The International Debt Analysis Project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization project that explores international debt data. It includes functionality to perform exploratory data analysis, visualize debt trends, aggregate and analyze data, and gain insights into global debt patterns. The project identifies key debt indicators, calculates total and average debt values by country, and highlights the highest principal repayment and the most common debt indicator.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `international_debt.csv`: The dataset containing international debt data.
- `international_debt_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook file containing the project code.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x)
- pandas
- Plotly Express
- Jupyter Notebook or a Python development environment

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/international-debt-analysis).

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:


###  Usage

The International Debt Analysis Project provides various functionalities for analyzing and visualizing international debt data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project includes extensive exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. It explores data statistics, data types, and unique country names and indicator codes.
Visualization
The project utilizes Plotly Express for data visualization. It includes scatter plots and bar plots to visualize debt data by country and indicator.

### Data Aggregation

The project aggregates data to calculate total debt and average debt values by country, offering a comprehensive view of debt statistics.

### Analysis and Insights
The project identifies the country with the highest principal repayment and the corresponding indicator. It also determines the most common debt indicator in the dataset.

### Data Source
The project uses data from the "international_debt.csv" file located in the project directory. This dataset contains information on international debt, including country names, indicators, and debt values.

### Functionality
#### Total Debt by Country
The project calculates and visualizes the total debt by country, providing a summary of the overall debt burden.
#### Average Debt by Country
It calculates and visualizes the average debt by country, offering insights into the average debt levels in different countries.
#### Highest Principal Repayment
The project identifies the country with the highest principal repayment and displays the corresponding indicator name, shedding light on significant debt repayments.
#### Most Common Debt Indicator
It finds and displays the most common debt indicator in the dataset, highlighting the prevailing debt type.
